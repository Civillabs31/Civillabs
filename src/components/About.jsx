  "Bridging the rural-urban divide"</b> </h5>
  <p>We are passionate about contributing to social development and have a strong desire
   to make a difference in the lives of rural students. We have initiated the Civil Labs 
   Rural Shiksha Programme (MRP), which aims to light up young minds. This is a digital 
   tutoring program meticulously designed to provide quality education to rural children.
    In collaboration with rural schools, we offer a learning platform that includes online
     classes in local languages, self-learning modules, personalized assessments, and fosters peer learning, 
     all under the guidance of dedicated Civil Labs. Our goal is to make quality education accessible, empowering
      young minds for a brighter future and transforming communities.</p>
  </div>

  <div className='socialB'>
  <h5><b>"Paint the School"</b></h5>
  <p>Students in rural areas spend a significant portion of their time at school, and when they observe the conditions
   of government schools, they often develop disinterest in attending. That's why, at Civil Labs, we have undertaken a
    heartfelt initiative to transform schools free of cost.Our mission is to breathe new life into these educational institutions, 
    making them more inviting and vibrant for the students. We understand that a well-maintained and aesthetically pleasing learning
     environment can have a profound impact on a child's enthusiasm for education. By renovating schools and giving them a fresh look, 
     we aim to kindle a renewed passion for learning in the hearts of the students. Witnessing the smiles on the faces of these children 
     as they step into their newly renovated school is the greatest reward. It's a testament to the positive change we bring to their lives,
      instilling hope and making their educational journey brighter and more enjoyable.</p>
  </div>

  <div className='socialC'>
  <h5><b>"Books for the Brain"</b></h5>
  <p>Books and school bags are indispensable tools for young students on their educational journey. At Civil Labs, we are deeply committed to 
  ensuring that every child's path to learning is clear and unobstructed. We firmly believe that no child should face barriers in their education
   due to the unavailability of essential school stationery. To realize this vision, we place great emphasis on providing students with the best 
   quality books for their studies. We understand that books are not just printed pages; they are windows to knowledge, gateways to imagination, 
   and keys to a world of opportunities. By equipping these young minds with the right educational materials, we empower them to explore their
    potential and unlock their academic prowess. We ensure no student is left behind due to the lack of essential learning resources. With "Books 
    for the Brain," we aim to instil a sense of curiosity and a love for learning in every child. By eliminating the obstacles that may hinder their 
    educational progress, we pave the way for a brighter future for all.</p>
